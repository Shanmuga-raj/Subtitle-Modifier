# Subtitle-Modifier

###### ```DESCRIPTION:```
This program is to *Modify the given Subtitle or Text File* using Python.
 
###### ```EXPLANATION:```
I have decided to watch a movie but movie language is different from my language. So, I downloaded a subtitle from internet. But when I play that movie with that subtitle file its display's some unwanted number's contained in that Subtitle file. So that I decided to find out and correct the error. I opened that .srt(subtitle) file. 
***
>#### That file is exactly as I shown below.....

>>0 <br /> 1 <br /> 00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,570 <br /> Now in the next few lessons we're going to be learning about something that's really really powerful, <br /> 1 <br /> <br /> 2 <br /> 00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,890 <br /> and it's the command line. And a lot of people will tell you that you can only truly call yourself a <br /> 2 <br /> <br /> 3 <br /> 00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,920 <br /> developer if you know at least how to use the command line. <br /> 3 <br /> <br /> 4 <br /> 00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,710 <br /> Now this depends on who you ask. <br /> 4 <br /> <br />

I found that numbers ie.,(0, 1, 1, 2, 2,...) is unwanted. It will take so long to remove that numbers manually. So I decided to write a code that would remove that unwanted numbers inbetween the file. 

>#### So, that after executing the program with the code that I wrote. It will look exactly same as below:

>>00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,570 <br /> Now in the next few lessons we're going to be learning about something that's really really powerful, <br /> <br /> 00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,890 <br /> and it's the command line. And a lot of people will tell you that you can only truly call yourself a <br /> <br /> 00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,920 <br /> developer if you know at least how to use the command line. <br /> <br /> 00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,710 <br /> Now this depends on who you ask.

I attached a sample file (subtitle.srt). So that, you can check it out and run on your PC.

I Made some modification to the code so that when you run it will ask you how many files you want to modify. After getting input from you Program will ask you the file name after entering the file name It will make changes and replace your file. 

#### NOTE: No need to mention format of the file while you enter the file name. (Eg: subtitle) You don't need to mention like this.. (Eg: subtitle.txt or subtitle.srt)

Mainly, this is my First program that I ever created. This code is created for my own need using all the things that gathered until now !!
